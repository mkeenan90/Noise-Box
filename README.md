# Noise-Box
## Summary 
I wanted to create the foundation for a noise machine to fulfill many different purposes around my house. My daughter falls asleep to the sound of lullabies; my wife and I use a fan for noise in our room. I'd like to replicate these noises with my own design.

The desired feature set is too large for the first iteration. These desired features are: bluetooth music streaming, selectable recordings of family members reading bedtime books, a daytime music box (coffee shop noise, meditation tracks, podcast player, etc.), Alexa capable, and whatever else I can think up.

In order to achieve these features, the first design focuses on just playing music from an SD card and a bunch of buttons for user input.
